   Jeu est un autre
========================

---

"Jeu est un autre" is a pedagogical musical piece for variable number of performers. composed by [Vincent-R. Carinola](https://www.vrcarinola.com/). 

The music score has been realized with INScore. It is basically designed to be driven by Max/MSP. 
This is an autonomous version of the score (it doesn't require Max/MSP to run).


## Principle

"Jeu est un autre"  is an animated music score. 

A cursor activated in real time, moves over the arcs that connect the different figures. We will talk about 'paths' to refer to these arcs.
This cursor can also stop on a figure which will then be momentarily highlighted. We will talk about 'stations' to refer to these figures.
The paper score gives playing instructions for each path and each station.



## Instructions for use

To start, drop the file "jeu.inscore" to an INScore window
Next you can choose between manual or automatic modes.



### Manual mode

Activate stations or paths manually: simulates the messages sent by Max

The following scripts activate stations and contain a single message:

	- 1-sculpture.inscore   /ITL/scene event P1 200;
	- 2-zebrure.inscore     /ITL/scene event P2 200;
	- 3-allure.inscore      /ITL/scene event P3 200;
	- 4-texture.inscore     /ITL/scene event P4 200;

200 represents the duration of the station activation.

The following scripts activate paths and contain 
also a single message:

	- 1-vers-2.inscore		/ITL/scene event P9 100;
	- 1-vers-4.inscore		/ITL/scene event P8 100;
	- 2-vers-1.inscore		/ITL/scene event P10 100;
	- 2-vers-3.inscore		/ITL/scene event P11 100;	
	- 3-vers-2.inscore		/ITL/scene event P12 100;	
	- 3-vers-4.inscore		/ITL/scene event P5 100;	
	- 4-vers-1.inscore		/ITL/scene event P7 100;
	- 4-vers-3.inscore		/ITL/scene event P6 100;

Finally the central station is activated with the script
	- centre.inscore		/ITL/scene event P13 200;
	
All durations are of course modifiable. 
Max strives to match paths and stations, now the interpretation remains free....


### Automatic mode

Simply drop the file `standalone.inscore` to the score.
