 Turenas - John Chowning (1972)
======================================================

Turenas score has been initialy designed by Laurent Pottier as an analytic representation of John Chowning piece and was part of the "Portraits Polychromes" published by the INA/GRM [*].
Using the original graphic material and thanks to additional representations provided by Laurent Pottier, the INScore scripts available in this folder allow to switch dynamically to different analytic views of the piece : you can drag and drop any of the 'schema*.inscore' files to the score, even while playing.
